## HEADER2

### Bold, Italics, and strikethroughs

This is a **bolded** text.
This is an *italicised* text.
You can also use __underscores__ to do the same _thing_.
This is a ~strikethrough~.

You can also *__combine__* the two.

Or even ~__*three*__~.

Note that paragraphs are separated by an empty line,

not

by

carriage return.

And no matter how much spaces you have in between the paragraphs, it will only insert one empty line between the paragraph.

If you want to rule a line (simple, yet difficult task to do in MS Word), just give a line of "=" or "-"

Here is one:

A different way of making a header
------------------------

This is how you make your text like a `code`.

It's quite handy when you want to talk about a command with similar names in normal text.

For example, I want to talk about the UNIX command `date`, and not about today's date.


If you have a block of codes, you might want to use this syntax:

```bash
# These are some intense commands:
echo hello world
cd ~
```

## Tables

In markdown, you can generate a table relatively easy:

|Name | Age | Sex | Favourite food|
|-----|-----|---|:----:|
|Riku | 25 | Male | Meat|
|Matt | 50 | Male | Re:burger|
|Ruth | 30 | Female | Tiramisu|

## Lists

Here are some bullet points:
* these 
* are 
* bullet 
* points

You can also use dashes for the same result:
- here
- you 
- go

What about numbered lists?
1. you can make 
1. numbered lists
1. like this
1. note that I'm only 
1. using a single number

There is a special GitHub-only lists (checklist):
- [ ] these
- [ ] are
- [ ] some
- [x] checklists

## Quotes

Here are some quotes:
> You're a wizard, Harry 

If you want a long quote, just keep typing and it will automatically wrap around, or you can separate it out your self:
> I'm a what?

> A wizard, Harry.

> But... But I **can't** be a wizard.

## Links

You can [link](https://www.google.com) stuff like [this](https://www.facebook.com)

## Images

This is how you insert an image:

![title of the image](Kirby.png)

You need to use HTML code snippet to resize an image:

<img src="Kirby.png" width=200 height=200/>
